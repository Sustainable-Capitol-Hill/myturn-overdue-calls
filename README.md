MyTurn Overdue Calls
---

This is a Google Apps Script project that (when combined with its Google Sheet) helps our tool library identify and make phone calls to patrons with long-overdue items, to encourage returning.

This repo includes code to authenticate with and pull loan reports from our [MyTurn](https://myturn.com) instance, and another module to add a [custom menu](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/guides/menus) to the Google Sheet to streamline staff phone calls to patrons with long-overdue items.
